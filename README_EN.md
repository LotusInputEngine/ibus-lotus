IBus Lotus is a fork of [IBus Bamboo](https://github.com/LotusInputEngine/ibus-lotus/), created to be the next generation of IBus Bamboo, with new features and some critical bug fixes, since IBus Bamboo has become silent and nobody maintains it.

## Installation
Please follow this [building instructions](docs/building_instructions.md) (Yeah sorry for not having a complete English version. But I'm sure you can figure out how to install it from that).

### Special Thanks to the great people who made this project possible!
